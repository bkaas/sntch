   The firmware is based off open source code called MultiWii.
   This is the same code used in Wii controllers.
   It has been adapted to be used for this HobbyKing Micro X quadcopter and 
   is posted here: http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2090915

   The code to ensure reliable serial communication with the sensor board
   is located in Protocol.cpp

   Welcome to MultiWii.

   If you see this message, chances are you are using the Arduino IDE. That is ok.
   To get the MultiWii program configured for your copter, you must switch to the tab named 'config.h'.
   Maybe that tab is not visible in the list at the top, then you must use the drop down list at the right
   to access that tab. In that tab you must enable your baord or sensors and optionally various features.
   For more info go to http://www.multiwii.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page

   Have fun, and do not forget MultiWii is made possible and brought to you under the GPL License.
